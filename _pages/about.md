I am an applied microeconomist at the Stockholm School of Economics who works in the fields of Industrial Organization, Economics of Education, and Health Economics. 

I am on the 2024/2025 academic job market. 

Previous to pursuing a PhD in Economics at [Stockholm School of Economics](https://www.hhs.se) I worked a [Swedish House of Finance](https://www.hhs.se/en/houseoffinance/) as a pre-doc. 
I hold a  Master of Science degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm as well as a Master of Science in Engernering degree in Engineering Physics (Civilingenj√∂r Teknisk fysik).
