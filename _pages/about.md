I am an applied microeconomist at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics [(IFN)](https://www.ifn.se/en) in Stockholm who works in the fields of Digital Economics, Economics of Education, and Health Economics. 

I earned my PhD in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics in 2025, with a dissertation named "Essays on Markets: Digital Attention, Market Definitions and Education".

Prior to pursuing a PhD in Economics at [Stockholm School of Economics](https://www.hhs.se), I worked at [Swedish House of Finance](https://www.hhs.se/en/houseoffinance/) as a pre-doc. 
I hold a  Master of Science degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, as well as a Master of Science in Engineering degree in Engineering Physics (Civilingenj√∂r Teknisk fysik).
