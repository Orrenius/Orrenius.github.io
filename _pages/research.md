Work in Progress

Value of attenion:

  * I document a large heterogeneity in the use of time as payment in mobile
games. By using a detailed event-level dataset I can estimate user elasticities
for a 30-second Reward Video. There are large individual and time hetero-
geneity. Looking at the population as a whole, the elasticity of a Reward
Video is 2.2 with regard to the in-game currency. The main explanatory
eect is individual heterogeneity in the use of Reward Videos, which when
ltered out reduces the elasticity to 0.8. I further nd that the elasticity of
a Reward Video is larger during the evenings. By relating the use of Reward
Videos to the price paid by the advertiser to show the ad to the user, I find
that the attention of individuals who watch more Reward Videos are valued
less by the advertisers, indicating eciency in the attention market. Finally,
I model the willingness to pay to not watch a Reward Video to 9.84 in-game
coins, corresponding to about 0.1 Euro.
