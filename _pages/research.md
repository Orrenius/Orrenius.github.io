Work in Progress

 
What is the value of attention? Supply and demand estimation of attention in a mobile phone setting:
 
I investigate the digital market for attention, documenting large heterogeneity in the use of attention as payment in mobile games. By using a detailed event-level dataset, I estimate user elasticities for a 30-second Rewarded Video, which is my unit of attention. In the aggregate, the elasticity of a  Rewarded Video is 2.2 with regard to the in-game currency of the mobile game. When accounting for individual heterogeneity the elasticity reduces to 0.8. I further find that the elasticity of a Rewarded Video is the largest during evenings. By relating the use of  Rewarded Videos to the price paid by the advertiser to show the ad to the user, I find that the attention of individuals who watch more  Rewarded Videos is valued less by the advertisers. Finally, I model the willingness to pay to avoid a  Rewarded Video to 9.71 in-game coins, corresponding to about 0.1 Euro. This is of the same magnitude as the value of time, as previously documented for the value of travel time.
