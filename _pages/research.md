**What is the value of attention? Supply and demand estimation of attention in a mobile phone setting**:

 [(Job Market Paper)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17270140/JMPdraft_orrenius_attention.pdf)


I study the digital market for attention in a freemium mobile game where users choose between paying with money or by watching 30-second video ads.
Using unique event-level data, I estimate consumer’s supply elasticity of attention. 
In the aggregate, a one percent higher price increases the share of payments by users watching videos by 2.2 percent. 
A substantial part is due to individual heterogeneity in tastes. 
Accounting individual heterogeneity reduces the elasticity to 0.5. 
The individual elasticities vary throughout the day, peaking in the evening. 
By analyzing the prices advertisers pay for each individual ad shown to consumers, I find advertisers pay more for users less likely to watch ads, with a stronger effect among Android users than iOS users. Finally, I estimate the willingness to accept a 30-second ad at 0.15 euros. This is of similar magnitude as previous estimates of consumer’s valuation of time.

**Market Definitions in the Real-estate Agents Market,  A Data-driven Approach Using Statistical Learning (with Adam Lindhe)**: 

We define geographic markets using a machine learning clustering algorithm. The algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm that uses data on customers' location and seller identity to define markets. The novelty of our method is that we leverage the seller identity of each observation to improve on pure distance-based measures of markets. We impose the intuition that a seller will focus on a few geographic markets and incorporate it into a Bayesian method. We empirically implement the method using a Gibbs sampler and estimate the geographic markets for real estate agents in Sweden. We find that our algorithm does significantly better than the standard geographic clustering algorithm, K-means. We get a Dice score of 0.78 compared to 0.67. We also find a distribution of the number of markets each agent works in closer to that of the validation set. The baseline K-means market definition indicates a lower market concentration than our market definition, where ours is closer to that of the validation set. Finally, we investigate the correct number of clusters and find that it in our example corresponds to the general knowledge of how the market is geographically structured.
